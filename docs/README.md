# Milsymbol Documentation

## Installing

You can download the latest release directly from GitHub if you want to:

https://github.com/spatialillusions/milsymbol/releases/latest

You can also get milsymbol using npm:

```
npm install milsymbol --save
```

AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. The module is always
named 'milsymbol' and in vanilla, a 'ms' global is exported:

```html
<script src="dist/milsymbol.js"></script>
<script>
  var symbol = new ms.Symbol("SFG-UCI----D", { size: 30 });
</script>
```

In a framework like [Dojo](https://dojotoolkit.org) you can load milsymbol like
this:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <script src="dojo/dojo.js" data-dojo-config="async: true"></script>
    <script src="app/milsymbol.js"></script>
    <script>
      require(["milsymbol"], function (ms) {
        var symbol = new ms.Symbol("SFG-UCI----D", { size: 30 });
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

This way of loading milsymbol makes it possible to use Dojo from an external
source, like js.arcgis.com.

If you only are using it with local sources or if you are uploading it to ArcGIS
Web AppBuilder, you can rebuild it by running `npm run build-amd`, and now you
can `require(["app/milsymbol"].....` if _milsymbol.js_ is placed in your app
folder. See more about building under [Building milsymbol](#building-milsymbol).

# Creating military unit symbols

Each symbol created with milsymbol is its own object and the properties of the
object can be updated or added after that the symbol object is created. The
symbol object also has methods to provide the symbol in different formats and
to provide information about the created symbol.

All functionality in milsymbol is normally found under the `ms` namespace, but
if you have imported milsymbol to another variable, you will have to use that
instead of `ms`.

## ms.Symbol(_arg1, arg2 ... argN_)

Initiates a new symbol object, where arg1-argN are options objects. If you
provide an argument that isn't an object we will assume that it is the SIDC for
the symbol.

Even if options can be provided or updated after the symbol object is created,
the performance will be better if you provide them directly when you create the
symbol, or to provide no arguments at all, this is because every time you update
some options the symbol will automatically be updated.

```javascript
var symbol = new ms.Symbol("SFG-UCI----D", { size: 30 });
```

Once you have initiated your symbol, you can use different methods to request
rendering of the symbol or get information about the symbol. It is also
possible to chain methods directly to the initiation:

```javascript
var symbol = new ms.Symbol("SFG-UCI----D", { size: 30 }).asSVG();
```

**General options**

It is possible to add any custom options to your options object as well as the
options listed below.

| Option | Type   | Default | Description             |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | ----------------------- |
| sidc   | String | ''      | The SIDC for the symbol |

**Modifier options**

The following options are modifiers, text or graphical, that are defined in the
standard documents.

It can be set to a Color object, or a string representing the name of a registered Color object. You can use ms.ColorMode to create a new color mode, or ms.getColorMode to get an existing color mode. **Note that the string is not a single color, it is a name of a registered color mode**, by default "Light", "Medium", and "Dark" are registered color modes. |

**Returns**

```javascript
String;
```

# Developing milsymbol

This describes more advanced development with milsymbol, this includes adding
your own symbols, overwriting existing icons and in other ways modifying the
standard output from milsymbol.

The base concept for milsymbol has been that everything that is used internally
to build up the symbols should be possible to modify, this makes it possible to
do everything from changing colors to adding completely new parts to the
generated symbols.

All the following code can be used to inject functionality into milsymbol
externally, but you can also choose to build your own version of milsymbol.

## Building milsymbol

Milsymbol is built using rollupjs, and if you installed
milsymbol npm everything you need to build milsymbol should have been installed
as well since they are listed as devDependencies in package.json, if you don't
have npm installed, you will have to install it to build milsymbol.

The structure of the code is that the rollup config (_rollup.config.js_) is
located in the root directory, and the entry point (_index.js_) and all other
source code is under `/src`.

Once you have changed the parts of the code that you want to change, you simply
run:

```
npm run build
```

Rollup will then build milsymbol and minify the output into `/dist`.

It is also possible to build an un-minified version of milsymbol by running:

```
npm run build-dev
```

And finally tests are located in the `/test` and you can run the tests by
running:

```
npm run test
```

## Draw instruction

The symbols in milsymbol are drawn using JSON draw instructions
`drawInstruction`, these are then converted into Canvas draw instructions, or
SVG output.

If you are creating your own JSON geometries for usage in milsymbol, they should
have the origo at 100,100, and the hight and width of the icon octagon is 100.
There is a sample SVG representing the symbol octagon available in the `dev
folder.

The following different kinds of draw instructions can be used in milsymbol:

```javascript
Object {
  type: 'path',
  d: String, // SVG path data
  fill: String, // Fill color  or set to false if none
  fillopacity: Number, // Fill opacity {Optional}
  stroke: String, // Stroke color  or set to false if none
  strokedasharray: String, // {Optional}
  strokewidth: Number, // Width of the stroke {Optional}
}
```

```javascript
Object {
  type: 'circle',
  cx: Number, // Center x
  cy: Number, // Center y
  r: Number, // Radius
  fill: String, // Fill color  or set to false if none
  fillopacity: Number, // Fill opacity {Optional}
  stroke: String, // Stroke color  or set to false if none
  strokedasharray: String, // {Optional}
  strokewidth: Number, // Width of the stroke {Optional}
}
```

```javascript
Object {
  type: 'text',
  x: Number,
  y: Number,
  textanchor: String,
  fontsize: Number,
  fontfamily: String,
  fontweight: String,
  fill: String, // Fill color or set to false if none
  fillopacity: Number, // Fill opacity {Optional}
  stroke: String, // Stroke color  or set to false if none
  strokedasharray: String, // {Optional}
  strokewidth: Number, // Width of the stroke {Optional}
}
```

```javascript
Object {
  type: 'translate',
  x: Number, // Move x
  y: Number, // Move y
  draw: drawInstruction
}
```

```javascript
Object {
  type: 'rotate',
  degree: Number, // Rotation angle
  x: Number, // Rotate center x
  y: Number, // Rotate center y
  draw: drawInstruction
}
```

```javascript
Object {
  type: 'scale',
  factor: Number, // Factor to scale
  draw: drawInstruction
}
```

```javascript
Object {
  type: 'svg',
  svg: String // Full SVG XML
}
```

Several draw instructions can be grouped together in an Array to for a more
complex part of a symbol, this is also a `drawInstruction` and the code will
handle both Objects and Arrays.

```javascript
Array [
  drawInstruction,
  drawInstruction,
  drawInstruction,
  drawInstruction,
  ...
]
```

## ms.BBox({box})

```javascript
Object {
  x1: Number, // Left coordinate {Optional}
  y1: Number, // Top coordinate {Optional}
  x2: Number, // Right coordinate {Optional}
  y2: Number, // Bottom coordinate {Optional}
}
```

Creates a bounding box Object. It is initiated with an optional object. Values
that are omitted will default to 100, and if an object isn't provided all values
will default to 100.

**Returns**

```javascript
Object {
  x1: Number, // Left coordinate
  y1: Number, // Top coordinate
  x2: Number, // Right coordinate
  y2: Number, // Bottom coordinate
  width: Function, // Returns box width
  height: Function, // Returns box height
  merge(box): Function // Merges one box with another and returns the original box
}
```

## ms.ColorMode(civilian, friend, hostile, neutral, unknown, suspect)

```javascript
civilian: String,
friend: String,
hostile: String,
neutral: String,
unknown: String,
suspect: String,
```

Creates a ColorMode Object with colors used for different affiliations.

**Returns**

```javascript
Object {
  Civilian: String,
  Friend: String,
  Hostile: String,
  Neutral: String,
  Unknown: String,
  Suspect: String
}
```

---

## ms.addIconParts(iconFunction)

```javascript
iconFunction: Function;
```

Adds an icon function to milsymbol. All icons on the symbols in milsymbol are
built by different icon parts, it can be one for Infantry and one for Armor, add
them together and you will have the icon for Armored Infantry. By reusing icon
parts as much as possible the size of milsymbol is reduced.

If you want to override built-in icon parts or add new to use with custom SIDC,
you can do this by adding an icon function.

Example:

```javascript
ms.addIconParts(
  function (iconParts, metadata, colors, std2525, monoColor, alternateMedal) {
    /*
    iconParts: Object - The existing object of icon parts
    metadata: Object - properties object
    colors: Object - color object
    std2525: Boolean - Is it 2525 then true, otherwise false
    alternateMedal: Boolean - true/false for sea mine stuff
    */

    // Adding a custom part for tactical graphics
    iconParts["TP.HARBOR"] = {
      type: "path",
      fill: false,
      d: "M 80,140 50,60 150,60 120,140",
    };

    /* 
    Since we are modifying directly to the existing object of icon parts, 
    we don't have to return anything.
    */
  }
);
```

**Returns**

```javascript
Object ms
```

## ms.addLabelOverrides(labelFunction, type)

```javascript
labelFunction: Function,
type: String // 'letter' or 'number' depending on the type of the SIDC
```

Adds label overrides to milsymbol. If you have some symbols that you want to
have labels that differ from how ordinary symbols are labeled, such as tactical
graphics, you can add label override functions that place the labels
differently.

Example:

```javascript
ms.addLabelOverrides(
  function tacticalPoints(sidc) {
    /*
    sidc: Object - The existing object of label overrides
    */

    /* 
    Creates an override for SIDC 'G-G-GPPK--', each option 
    listed will be applied to the text drawInstruction
    */
    sidc["G-G-GPPK--"] = {
      additionalInformation: {
        stroke: false,
        textanchor: "middle",
        x: 100,
        y: -70,
        fontsize: 40,
      },
      hostile: {
        stroke: false,
        textanchor: "start",
        x: 150,
        y: 45,
        fontsize: 40,
      },
      uniqueDesignation: {
        stroke: false,
        textanchor: "start",
        x: 150,
        y: 0,
        fontsize: 80,
      },
      dtg: { stroke: false, textanchor: "end", x: 50, y: -30, fontsize: 40 },
      dtg1: { stroke: false, textanchor: "end", x: 50, y: 10, fontsize: 40 },
    };

    /* 
    Since we are modifying directly to the existing object of overrides, 
    we don't have to return anything.
    */
  },
  "letter" //Setting letter as SIDC type
);
```

**Returns**

```javascript
Object ms
```

## ms.addSIDCicons(sidcFunction, type)

```javascript
sidcFunction: Function,
type: String // 'letter' or 'number' depending on the type on the SIDC
```

Adds a function for creating icons representing different SIDCs. It is possible
to add custom SIDC, or to modify existing SIDC by adding a custom SIDC function.

Example:

```javascript
ms.addSIDCicons(
  function tacticalPoints(sidc, bbox, icnParts, std2525) {
    /*
    sidc: Object - The existing object of SIDC 
    bbox: Object - The existing object of Bounding Boxes for SIDC
    iconParts: Object - The existing object of icon parts
    std2525: Boolean - Is it 2525 then true, otherwise false
    */

    // Creating a new SIDC
    sidc["G-T-D-----"] = icn["TP.DESTROY"];
    bbox["G-T-D-----"] = { x1: 0, x2: 200, y1: 40, y2: 160 };

    // If we don't provide a bounding box, it will be set to the bounds of the icon octagon
    sidc["G-T-I-----"] = icn["TP.INTERDICT"];

    /* 
    Since we are modifying directly to the existing object of SIDCs, 
    we don't have to return anything.
    */
  },
  "letter" //Setting letter as SIDC type
);
```

**Returns**

```javascript
Object ms
```

## ms.addSymbolPart(part)

```javascript
part: function
```

Adds a new symbol function to milsymbol. A symbol function is a function that
returns an Object with two arrays of drawInstruction and one bounding box, like this:

```javascript
Object {
  pre: [drawInstruction, ...], // This is to be drawn before anything else
  post: [drawInstruction, ...], // This is to be drawn after anything else
  bbox: bbox // The bounding box of the added drawInstructions
}
```

By inserting a pre and a post drawInstruction, we are able to draw parts of
the symbol that requires information, such as bounding boxes, previously drawn,
but to draw them before the other parts are drawn. It's quite clever, trust me.

```js
ms.addSymbolPart(function myExtension(ms) {
  const options = this.getOptions();

  const bbox = new ms.BBox();
  const preDrawArray = [];
  const postDrawArray = [];

  // some logic

  return {
    pre: preDrawArray,
    post: postDrawArray,
    bbox,
  };
});
```

**Returns**

```javascript
Object ms
```

milsymbol was built in a modular way: each feature (such as text fields, direction, etc.) was implemented as a part. Take a look at the source code to see how to design your own extensions. (ex: [debug extension](https://github.com/spatialillusions/milsymbol/blob/master/src/symbolfunctions/debug.js))

## ms.getColorMode(mode)

```javascript
mode: String; // Name of a color mode registered with setColorMode
```

Gets a color mode that has been registered with `setColorMode`. When milsymbol is
initiated the following color modes are registered automatically:

| Color mode name | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Light           | Light fill colors.                                |
| Medium          | Medium fill colors.                               |
| Dark            | Dark fill colors.                                 |
| FrameColor      | Frame colors for unfilled symbols.                |
| IconColor       | Icon colors for unfilled and unframed symbols.    |
| Black           | This is all black.                                |
| White           | This is all white.                                |
| OffWhite        | This is off white, used for white parts of icons. |
| None            | This is no color, used to turn colors off.        |

**Returns**

```javascript
Object {
  Civilian: String,
  Friend: String,
  Hostile: String,
  Neutral: String,
  Unknown: String,
  Suspect: String
}
```

## ms.getDashArrays()

Gets the different dash arrays used for dashed lines.

**Returns**

```javascript
Object {
  pending: String, // The value for the stroke-dasharray used for symbols with a pending status.
  anticipated: String, // The value for the stroke-dasharray used for symbols with an anticipated status.
  feintDummy: String // The value for the stroke-dasharray used for the feint/dummy modifier.
}
```

## ms.getHqStaffLength()

Gets the length of the HQ staff used for HQ symbols.

**Returns**

```javascript
Number;
```

## ms.getSymbolParts()

This gets all symbol functions that have been inserted by `ms.addSymbolPart`.

**Returns**

```javascript
Array [
  symbolFunction,
  symbolFunction,
  symbolFunction,
  ...
]
```

## ms.getVersion()

Gets the version of milsymbol.

**Returns**

```javascript
String;
```

## ms.outline(drawInstruction, outline, stroke, color)

```javascript
drawInstruction: drawInstruction,
outline: Number,
stroke: Number,
color: String
```

Takes the drawInstruction in the input and modifies them so that they only are
stroked.

Outline is the outline width, stroke is the original stroke width, and color is
the color the outline should have.

**Returns**

```javascript
Array or Object
```

## ms.setColorMode(name, colormode)

```javascript
name: String,
colormode: ColorMode
```

Register a ColorMode with a name or override an existing ColorMode.

**Returns**

```javascript
Object ColorMode
```

## ms.setDashArrays(pending, anticipated, feintDummy)

```javascript
pending: String, // The value for the stroke-dasharray used for symbols with a pending status.
anticipated: String, // The value for the stroke-dasharray used for symbols with an anticipated status.
feintDummy: String // The value for the stroke-dasharray used for the feint/dummy modifier.
```

Sets the dash arrays used for dashed lines.

Example:

```javascript
var dashObj = ms.setDashArrays("4,4", "8,12", "8,8");
```

**Returns**

```javascript
Object {
  pending: String,
  anticipated: String,
  feintDummy: String
}
```

## ms.setHqStaffLength(staff_length)

```javascript
staf_length: Number;
```

Sets the length of the HQ staff used for HQ symbols.

**Returns**

```javascript
Number;
```

## ms.setStandard(standard)

```javascript
standard: String; // '2525' or 'APP6'
```

This sets the preferred standard.

Sometimes APP6 and 2525 differ in symbols. Default we are using 2525 symbology,
but you can select to follow APP6 instead. (All possible SIDC will have some
kind of symbol no matter setting, so you will always get a symbol.)

**Returns**

```javascript
Boolean; // true if the standard was set, otherwise false
```

## ms.setSymbolParts(parts)

```javascript
parts: Array; // Array of symbolFunctions
```

Replaces the current symbol functions with an Array of symbol functions. This
can be used to modify the symbol functions that are built into milsymbol.

**Returns**

```javascript
Object ms
```


## Usage with TypeScript

If you develop extensions to enhance the library, you'll probably want to define new options that you'll use in your code. If you're using TypeScript, you can add a definition file to your project.

```ts
// ./your-project/src/milsymbol.d.ts
import "milsymbol";
declare module "milsymbol" {
  export interface SymbolOptions {
    customOption?: number
  }
}
```

Then in the extension:

```ts
import ms from "milsymbol";
import { type DrawInstruction } from "milsymbol";

ms.addSymbolPart(function (ms) {
  const options = this.getOptions();

  const bbox = new ms.BBox();
  const preDrawArray: DrawInstruction[] = [];
  const postDrawArray: DrawInstruction[] = [];


  const custom = options.customOptions; // Type-Safe

  // your code...

  return {
    pre: preDrawArray,
    post: postDrawArray,
    bbox,
  };
});
```
